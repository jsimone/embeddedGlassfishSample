This is a JEE6 full sample with JSF2.0, EJB3.1 and JPA2.0 based on the post at http://weblogs.java.net/blog/2009/07/24/jsf-20-jpa-glassfish-and-mysql.

It was taken from this blog post: http://www.tikalk.com/java/your-first-jee6-project-with-ejb-light-jpa-20-and-jsf-20-jbossas-6

It's been altered to use embedded glassfish and postgres. It's also been set up to run on Heroku.
